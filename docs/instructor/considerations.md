Missing Elements & Opportunities for Enhancement:

Financial Projections: The case mentions that NewCo will need to hire several employees at significant salaries but provides no pro-forma financial statements. Including a simplified income statement, cash flow projection, and a burn rate calculation would ground the negotiation in financial reality. This forces students to analyze how long NewCo's initial capital will last and how the proposed terms impact their financial runway.

Market and Competitive Analysis: The module states the technology makes internet streaming faster and can work with BigTech's competitors, but it lacks market context. A brief summary of the competitive landscape, Total Addressable Market (TAM), and potential exit strategies (e.g., acquisition by a competitor, IPO) would add a strategic layer. This would allow students to better argue valuation and understand BigTech's motivations for the spin-off beyond simply letting the tech compete in a free market.

Detailed Confidential Memo for NewCo: The module provides a "confidential" section for BigTech, outlining their non-negotiable points and strategic concerns. NewCo's section is more of a list of concerns rather than a confidential strategy memo. To create better parity and teach strategic preparation, a parallel confidential memo for NewCo should be developed. This could include:

    BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement): What will Baker and Carter do if the deal with BigTech falls through? Can they develop alternative technology? Do they have other potential investors?

    Reservation Point: What is the absolute maximum equity they are willing to give up? What is their walk-away point?

    Personal Motivations: The founders chose to move back to Madison for family reasons. This personal factor could influence their risk tolerance and desire for control. Explicitly stating these motivations adds a realistic human element to the negotiation.

Post-Negotiation Debrief and Reflection: The exercise currently concludes after the negotiation. A crucial part of experiential learning is reflection. Adding a structured debriefing section would solidify the learning. This section could include prompts such as:

For both teams: "What were the key turning points in the negotiation? What strategy did the other side use that was most effective?"

For NewCo: "How does the final agreement impact your ability to raise the next round of funding? What is your immediate 90-day plan following this deal?"


For BigTech: "Does this agreement meet the strategic goals of your venture group and address the Board of Directors' concerns?"
