A presentation by Jeffrey M. Glazer

## Think Marriage, Not War

This is the start of a multi-year relationship. An overly aggressive negotiation can poison the well before you even start.

**Fair Deal \!= Winning Deal** Your investors are your partners. Their success is tied to yours. The goal is to find a "fair" deal, not a "winning" deal. A fair deal aligns incentives for everyone.

### Key Concept: Economics + Control
{:.keyconcept}

Every term sheet boils down to two things:

* **Economics:** Who makes how much money and when?  
* **Control:** Who gets to make what decisions?

---

## Leverage

**Competition**
Try to have more than 1 investor at the table. Your greatest source of leverage is a competitive process; having more than one investor at the table changes the entire dynamic. Similarly, don't be desperate. Be our raising money *before* you are out of money.

**Traction**
Show progress. Tell stories of actual customer discovery (customers are people who pay you that are not related to you), pilot programs, LOIs, key hires, IP filings. A successful pilot with a municipal or industrial partner is gold. People often put too much pressure here; ANY user is a user; sure paying users are BETTER, but any user (that isn't related to you) is traction.

A quick note on *customers* v *users*: Customers are people who pay you. Users are people that use the product or service. They are not always the same person. For example, in social media you are not the customer, you are the *user* (or, more cynically, the product); the companies that pay for ads are the *customers*.

**Narrative \+ Source/Use of Funds**
Know your pitch, but, more importantly, know your finances. How much do you need? What are you going to do with it? When and how much is the next round? How does this relate to your story and growth narrative? A detailed, credible use-of-funds plan builds confidence.

**Golden Rule**
S/He who has the gold makes the rules. Unless you have something they can't get anywhere else (what makes you [defensibly](https://medium.com/@cianoconnor/what-makes-a-business-defensible-b4ce4750bb14) unique?). What does the angel/fund care about? Financial return? Strategic advantage? Impact? Tailor your pitch accordingly.

## Who Are Early Stage Investors

**Angels** Often successful local/regional entrepreneurs.  

* May offer valuable mentorship and network access.  
* Decision-making can be slower (by committee).  
* Often more patient and potentially mission-aligned (important for water tech).  

**Super Angels** High-net-worth individuals, often former founders or tech executives.  

* Act like micro-VCs; write larger checks ($250k+).  
* Decisions are fast. Can be demanding but also incredibly helpful.  

**Seed-stage Venture Capital** Professional money managers.  

* More structured, more demanding terms, but larger checks and deeper pockets for follow-on rounds.  
* Typically enter at a slightly later stage (Series A), but some have Seed programs.

## Investment Instruments

**Un-Priced Rounds** The company's valuation is not set today. It's kicked down the road.  

* Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE)
* Convertible Note: A loan that converts to equity

**Priced Rounds** The company's valuation is set today. You are selling a specific percentage of your company for a specific dollar amount.

* Series Seed/Preferred  
* Requires valuation  

**Other (Patient Capital)**  

* Royalty-Based Financing: Investor gets a percentage of revenue. Can be non-dilutive but may be a long-term drag on cash flow. More common for businesses with predictable revenue, less so for high-growth tech startups.
* Stock Buy-back Schedule

## SAFE \+ Convertible Note

What's the difference?  

Terms common to both:

* Valuation Cap  
* Discount Rate  
* Pre/Post-Money (MFN)  

Terms specific to convertible notes:

* Interest Rate  
* Maturity Date

### Key Concept: The Two Key Levers
{:.keyconcept}

**Valuation Cap:** The maximum valuation at which the investor's money converts to equity. You want this to be higher; the investor wants it lower.  
* *Example:* $1M SAFE with a $10M cap. If the next round is at $20M, the SAFE holder converts at the $10M price, effectively doubling their ownership stake compared to new investors.

**Discount Rate:** A discount the investor gets on the price of the next round. Typically 15-20%.
* *Example:* Next round is priced at $1.00/share. A 20% discount means the SAFE holder converts at $0.80/share.

**Other Concepts:**

**Pre/Post-Money:** Are you using a "Pre-Money" or "Post-Money" SAFE? Post-money SAFEs are investor-friendly and have become more common. They can be significantly more dilutive to founders. Understand the math\!  

**MFN:** The holder of an MFN instrument always gets the most favorable negotiated deal in the round.
* *Example:* Investor A has MFN; Investor B negotiates a 5% discount rate; Investor C negotiates a 20% discount rate. Investor A (all other things equal) will get Investor C's 20% discount rate.

**Convertible Note:** is debt\!\!  
* **Interest Rate:** A small interest rate (2-8%) that accrues and is added to the principal that converts to equity.
* **Maturity Date:** A date (typically 18-24 months) by which, if a priced round hasn't occurred, the note is due.

*[MFN]: Most Favored Nation

## **Priced Rounds (Series Seed)**

* **Economics**  
  * Pre-Money Valuation  
  * Investment Amount  
  * Option Pool  
  * Liquidation Preferences  
  * Anti-Dilution (tag along/drag along/ROFR)  
* **Control**  
  * Board Seats/Composition  
  * Veto Rights  
  * Voting Rights

**Notes:**

* Even if you raise on a SAFE, it will convert into this structure, so you need to understand it.  
* Valuation isn't everything.  
* **Key Economic Terms (The Money):**  
  * Pre-Money Valuation  
  * Investment Amount  
  * **Option Pool:** The option pool (for future employees) is almost always created before the investment, reducing the founder's effective valuation. *Example:* An investor agrees to a $10M "pre-money" valuation but requires a 20% option pool. The pool is created from the existing equity, so the true pre-money valuation of the company is now $8M.  
  * **Liquidation Preference:** The most important economic term after price.  
    * **Standard/Fair:** 1x, Non-Participating. Investor gets the first money out in a saleâ€”either their investment back OR their ownership percentage, whichever is greater.  
    * **Avoid:** Participating Preferred. The investor gets their money back AND their ownership percentage. This is a form of double-dipping and is no longer market standard for early rounds.  
  * Anti-Dilution Rights  
* **Key Control Terms (The Decisions):**  
  * **Board of Directors:** Control often starts here. A typical 3-person seed stage board: 1 Founder Seat, 1 Investor Seat, 1 Independent Seat (mutually agreed upon). Avoid giving up control of the board (e.g., a 2-1 investor-founder ratio).  
  * **Protective Provisions:** A list of major corporate actions that require investor approval (a "veto right"). Standard: Selling the company, changing the articles of incorporation, issuing senior stock, taking on significant debt.  
  * **Red Flag:** Vetoes over operational decisions like hiring/firing executives, annual budgets, or pivoting the business.  
  * Other Voting Rights

## **Water Tech Considerations**

* Time \+ Money  
* Intellectual Property  
* Regulatory (EPA/Great Lakes/etc)  
* Mission-Aligned

**Notes:**

* **Longer Timelines & Capital Intensity:** Your R\&D and sales cycles can be long. Raise enough capital to hit meaningful milestones. A 24-month runway is safer than 18\.  
* **Intellectual Property (IP):** Be prepared for intense due diligence on your patents and proprietary technology. Ensure your IP is cleanly owned by the corporation, not a founder or university.  
* **Regulatory Hurdles (e.g., EPA approvals):** Investors will price this risk. Having a clear, credible plan for navigating the regulatory landscape is a major asset and de-risks the investment.  
* **Mission-Aligned Capital:** The "impact" investor universe is a real asset for you. Seek out investors who understand the water space and share your long-term vision. They can be more patient and provide more relevant strategic value.

## **Red Flags and Warnings**

* Exploding Term Sheets/Unreasonable Deadlines  
* Valuation Cap/Pre-Money Focus  
* Dilution Math  
* GET A LAWYER THAT KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING\!

**Notes:**

* **The "Exploding" Term Sheet:** Unreasonable deadlines (e.g., "sign in 48 hours") are a pressure tactic. A professional investor will give you time.  
* **Focusing only on the Valuation Cap / Pre-Money.** A high valuation with bad terms (like participating preferred or losing board control) is a bad deal.  
* **Not getting experienced legal counsel.** This is not the place to save money. An experienced startup lawyer has seen hundreds of these deals and knows what's market standard. They pay for themselves many times over.  
* **Not understanding dilution from future rounds, SAFEs, and the option pool.** Model it out in a spreadsheet\! (better yet, use CARTA\!\!\!)

## **Timeline of a Deal**

1. Introduction/Pitch/Relationship Building  
2. Term Sheet Signed  
3. Due Diligence  
4. Document Drafting  
5. Closing  
6. ???  
7. Profit (cash that check, yo\!)

**Notes:**

* **Intro:** Think in ROUNDS, not DEALS  
* **Term Sheet Signed:** Mostly non-binding, but creates moral commitment. Exclusivity ("no-shop") and confidentiality clauses are usually binding.  
* **Due Diligence (2-4 weeks):** The investor's lawyers and analysts will verify everything. Financials, technology, legal structure, customer contracts, etc. Be organized\!  
* **Drafting Definitive Documents:** The term sheet is expanded into lengthy, binding legal contracts. Your lawyer will handle this heavy lifting.  
* **Closing:** You sign a mountain of paperwork.  
* **The Wire Hits:** The investment funds are wired to your company's bank account. Congratulations, now the real work begins.
