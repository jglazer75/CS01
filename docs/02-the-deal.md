## Resources
{:.keyconcept}

The following are some really good resources for understanding term sheets and the mechanics of what's going on here. There are a lot of specialized words going on here. Things like "Exclusive License", "Field of Use", "Non-Dilution" (more on this later), and others. It can be overwhelming if you are new to the language.

Brad Feld. [Venture Deals](https://venturedeals.com/). This book is written for entrepreneurs to help them better under the legal issues underlying typical term sheets. It is a short(ish), fast read and has great detail and stories.

[A Primer on Negotiating Term Sheets](./02-Negotiating-term-sheets.md). This is a summary of a presentation on the context of how many of these terms arise.
