## PARTIES

**BigTechCo, Inc. ("BigTech")** is a very large, Silicon Valley-based, publicly traded, Fortune 100, hardware technology company with a considerable in-house research and development group. BigTech's primary business is the manufacturing of central processing units for desktop computers and mobile devices. Like many large companies, BigTech frequently expands through acquisition of related technologies. It also develops its own technologies in-house and even has a special program that encourages and rewards employee entrepreneurial endeavors. Where the in-house developments are speculative or merely tangentially related to BigTech's central line of business, BigTech will spin-off the technology into its own company to live or die on its own. Executives at BigTech believe this lets the technology compete in a free market as any other startup which can accelerate the technology and could create a nice return on investment for BigTech. As the technology develops, BigTech will sometimes buy-out the startup once the technology is proven thus bringing it back in-house, but frequently it will simply maintain its equity position in this new company and hold it as it would any other stock in its investment portfolio.

As part of BigTech's investment portfolio it allocates approximately 15% of the total portfolio to high-risk venture capital investments made either in its own name or as part of a venture or angel investment group. Startups that arise through their own research are included in the 15% high risk allocation. BigTech's Board of Directors is intrigued by the return on investment potential of this high-risk portfolio but is always worried about shareholder reactions to this portion of the company's operations. Able is the Director of the BigTech Venture Group.

**NewCo Tech Company, Inc. ("NewCo")** is a startup located in Madison, Wisconsin. NewCo was founded by Baker and Carter, both ex-employees of BigTech. Baker is an electrical engineer, with a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin ("UW") and worked on new hardware projects at BigTech. Carter is also a graduate of the UW with a degree in software engineering. He worked on firmware and operating system architecture at BigTech. As part of BigTech's research and development team they created a new software-based routing system that will make streaming on the internet significantly faster. While the technology works in conjunction with BigTech's hardware, the system will actually work with any hardware. BigTech thought this technology would actually have a bigger impact if it were spun-off into its own company where it could work with BigTech and its competitors. In January of 2017, BigTech gave Baker and Carter a substantial severance package and permission to start NewCo.

## FACTS

Baker and Carter, being alumni of the University of Wisconsin at Madison and with family in the area, have chosen to move back to Madison and start up NewCo. They sought out legal services from the University of Wisconsin Law and Entrepreneurship Clinic ("L\&E Clinic"). In conjunction with the L\&E Clinic, Baker and Carter formed NewCo Tech Company, Inc. a Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business in Madison, WI. They have rented office space at University Research Park and used part of their severance package to purchase the equipment they will need to finalize research on the system that they are calling NETWORKFUNCTION.

Baker will be the CEO and Carter will be the CTO. They will need to hire 3-5 engineers for research and 1 marketing officer to start doing customer validation. Together these 6 positions will each cost at least $100,000 per year plus equity incentives. The L\&E Clinic is creating an employee option pool representing approximately 100,000 shares of NewCo.

Baker and Carter will forego salaries until NewCo is generating revenue; Baker will own 550,000 shares of NewCo and Carter will own 450,000. Their interests will vest pro-rata over the next four years with a 1-year cliff of 25% of the vesting interest. They valued their contributed assets of equipment and cash at $50,000 enough to get them a full year of rent, a small travel budget, and any additional equipment they might need.

| Name | Date of Acquisition | Shares | Vested | Valuation | Share Price |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Baker | 01/01/2017 | 550,000 | 137,500 | $50,000 | $0.05 |
| Carter | 01/01/2017 | 450,000 | 112,500 | $50,000 | $0.05 |
| Employee Option Pool | TBD | 100,000 |  | TBD | TBD |
| Proposed BigTech | Date of Close | 165,000 | 165,000 | $132,000 | $0.80 |

The core technology of NETWORKFUNCTION was created at BigTech. Based on the employment contracts of Baker and Carter and intellectual property law, anything the two created at BigTech is the property of BigTech. BigTech has filed two patents and is claiming copyright over the core functionality that is NETWORKFUNCTION. The first patent covers the firmware implementation of the system ("P294"), the second patent covers the cloud architecture necessary for the system ("P573"), the copyright covers the software necessary for the system to operate ("C483;" together, all are "Core IP").
